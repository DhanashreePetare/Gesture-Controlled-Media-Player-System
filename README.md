## Gesture-Controlled-Media-Player-System
Developed a Machine Learning project which include handling media operations such as play, pause etc using hand gestures.

**Tech Stack-**<br>
*Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)*  
*Libraries : Tensorflow, keras, OpenCV, PyAutoGui.*

**Functionality-**<br>
Gestures and their respective mapped functions:
1.no-action-no-gesture  
2.play/pause-Palm Open  
3.mute-Fist  
4.volume_down-Thumbs down  
5.volume_up-Thumbs up  
6.forward-Index-right  
7.rewind-Index-left  

~Also tried to increase the functionalty by adding new gestures and mapping them with new functions to increase or decrease speed of the on going media.
